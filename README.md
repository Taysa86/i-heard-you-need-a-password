# i-heard-you-need-a-password

## Description

This is a Random password generator designed to help me practice my javascript. I learned to use concat format to chain my strings, I created functions, and I created a loop.
I also discovered why console.log is so useful. Until now it seemed like a weird command to learn, and I didn't really recognize the practical applications. This project gave me some
trouble, largely due to it coinsiding with a couple of deaths in the family, but that made completing it all the sweeter.


## Usage

To opperate the generator, simply click the button and follow the prompts. It will ask you to choose your password length, and then it will prompt you to select what sort of characters you'd like to include. Once you have answered all of the prompts, you will be given your password.


## Credits

I'd like to thank my tutor, Abduraghmaan Gabriels, he understood what I was trying to show him even though I wasn't certain which questions I 
should be asking. He helped me find ways to overcome the blocks I was facing and put my vision to code. In particular, chaining my strings together usiong concat.
